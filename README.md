# Reciparse.com

Reciparse is built on React/Next.js, Node/Express, Tailwind, Supabase & and served to you via Vercel. Issues and pull requests from the community are welcome! Read on for details on getting started.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Env Variables

See `example.env` for the environment variables you'll need to get started - Supabase & Edamam details for starters. Contact me for database migration details to get your own Supabase instance set up.
